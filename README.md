    My passion project was when I was teaching students about computer science and also the basics in coding. I engaged the students in a whole-group discussion on why computer science is necessary for the future. Afterwards, students used code.com, and google code to learn the basics of logic problems including the use of  for, if, do, while, and boolean statements. At the end of the project my students were able to present on their project which included a creative sketch using Scratch. 

* Quantitative Accomplishments

    + I have completed 2 years of Teach for America.
    + I have a Political Science Degree.
    + I have a year of international experience. 

* Qualitative Accomplishments

	+ I am a strong planner. (This can lead to me not being flexible in my options.)
	+ I have grit. (This can lead to me not ending something when perhaps it should have ended.)

Weekly reflection 1/23 - 1/29
This last week was a difficult time for me with understanding the core concepts of the Java language and syntax. I am still unsure of my capacity to learn this language but I am very interested and I think if I can maintain that interest and drive I will be an effective developer given that I have the time. I need to spend long hours doing tedious tasks and this will ensure an understanding of the language. This also includes longer practice using programs like coding bat and hacker rank to improve my syntactical skills. I feel glad to be on the other side of this week and to be looking forward to greater understanding of this language.

Weekly reflection 1/29 - 2/4
This second week of the bootcamp was difficult for me. I was very challendged mentally and I had difficult times following the content and how it worked out. I think that I need even more practice than what I am getting currently in the classroom. Following up on this I purchased a class on Udemy for Java Masterclass and I am hoping that the additional practice from this course will enable me to be present in class without fear of falling behind. I am worried for the next week but that is a good feeling also. I am looking forward to it. 

Weekly reflection 2/5 - 2/10
This third week of bootcamp was an entirely different game than the previous two weeks. We started our discussions on data structures and talked about bubble sort, we also created a new application that plays the game of Craps for it's users. We are on chapter 8 of the book and have basically finished all of the basic syntax for the Java language. It is difficult to fathom how far i've come but I am looking forward to more as we go!

Weekly reflection 2/11 - 2/17
This 4th week was truly terrifying but also comforting to a degree. We had our large unit test and I feel like I comprehended the problems and I was able to at least attempt the problems although I definitely did not solve every problem in the given time. It was a good challenge and it makes me look ahead to this week and what it will be bringing. I think if I can focus on my mathematics and logic understanding, I can become a strong programmer. It will take dedication and working everyday.
