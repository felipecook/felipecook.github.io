I did a little bit of research in the local area and I would be okay with a salary of around 70,000$ for a junior developer position in the ABQ area. I did research on other cities in the area and this was definitely a good salary for my location. If I had to live in an area like Denver or San Francisco, I would like a salary more in the range of 90,000$ in order to compensate for higher living costs.
